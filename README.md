## 💻 My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### [Predicting Cancer Using GradientBoost](https://github.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Cancer%20using%20GradientBoost/predicting_cancer_using_gradientboost(portafolio_edition).ipynb)
![False Negatives Threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/main/Predicting%20Cancer%20using%20GradientBoost/false_negatives_threshold.png)
This project aims to predict cancer using the GradientBoost algorithm. The dataset includes features like age, BMI, physical activity, alcohol intake, gender, smoking habits, family history of cancer, and diagnosis. Key steps involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training the GradientBoost model. The focus is on optimizing the model to minimize false negatives, ensuring a balance between sensitivity and specificity. The project concludes with model evaluation and visualization of results.

### [Classification with Academic Success Using LGBM](https://github.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/blob/main/Classification%20with%20academic%20success%20using%20LGBM/classification_with_academic_success_using_lgbm(portafolio_edition).ipynb)
![Academic Success EDA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/main/Classification%20with%20academic%20success%20using%20LGBM/academic_success_eda.jpeg)
This project uses LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) to classify academic success based on various features such as age, marriage status, and international status. The notebook includes steps for data visualization, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced classes using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The trained LightGBM model is evaluated on a validation set, and predictions are made on test data.

### [ML Emotions vs Social Media Usage (AutoML + Clustering)](https://github.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/blob/main/ML%20emotions%20vs%20social%20media%20usage%20(automl%2Bcluster)/ml_emotions_vs_social_media_usage_automl_cluster(portafolio_eidtion).ipynb)
![Clustering Results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pauloarayasantiago/portafolio/main/ML%20emotions%20vs%20social%20media%20usage%20(automl%2Bcluster)/clustering_results.png)
This project explores the relationship between emotions and social media usage using AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) and clustering techniques. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying clustering algorithms to identify patterns and groups within the data. The project highlights key findings from the clustering results and discusses their implications on understanding social media usage patterns.
