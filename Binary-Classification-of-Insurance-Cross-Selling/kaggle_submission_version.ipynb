This notebook demonstrates my end-to-end workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to feature engineering and model tuning. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately predicts insurance responses. This particular version of this notebook is meant to be ran in Kaggle and displayed for the competition.","metadata":{"id":"jvh6IYIuv7E9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preliminary Tests and Findings\n\nThis notebook is the culmination of the creation of at least 50 different notebooks for this competition. As of the creation of this version I still haven't been able to obtain my ideal score, but I decided to share my favorite parts of my work. I started by testing the dataset on different models with only the necessary transformations done to the features. XGBoost and LightGBM stood out from the start. I settled on trying to perfect the LightGBM model by running it through hundreds of iterations across multiple weeks on OPTUNA. When I was satisfied with the validation scores, I submitted it to the competition and the results were lackluster. This led me to take a deep dive into other notebooks scoring high in the competition (all of which are referenced below). After trying all sorts of feature engineering techniques, through testing and research I found that the dataset worked best with the addition of a few interaction features. I later found a notebook along the highest scoring ones that created a blend out of other people's submissions. I found this interesting and decided to concuct my own blend. At first the blend created an averaged prediction through stratified KFolds but it was too computationally expensive, so I settled with three straight forward models.","metadata":{"id":"9lVR_MUgv7E-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Early Explorations\n\nI first started with a little exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data processing. The data comes pretty clean, but the dataset is MASSIVE. The largest I had worked with previously had been around 70k rows, but this one had 11 million. Not many columns though. Most columns were fairly easy to handle except for `Region_Code` and `Policy_Sales_Channel`. I treated those by binning them into a rare category due to the heavy imbalance towards some values. Otherwise, everything was treated pretty basically.\n\nI made some basic EDA graphs to explore the data, using some base models to understand feature importances. Later, I discovered the magic of KLIB from another notebook: [Optuna XGBoost KLIB Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/suvroo/ps4e7-optuna-xgboost-klib), which taught me a thing or two about cleaning the data easily with KLIB, and how to keep track of hyperparameter studies with Optuna and some of its also amazing graphs.\n\nAt first, I applied the basic preprocessing steps necessary to run the dataset efficiently in the models I was using. Also incorporating some downcasting to the workflow so that the model would work more efficiently. I tried applying some additional transformations to the data like removing outliers, creating rare categories for feature values with low counts, and creating KMEANS cluster feature. I also tested borrowed feature interactions from other notebooks and created my own. After possibly hundreds of tests, I settled on a combination of my own feature interactions and a set of feature interactions from [this Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohanrao/automl-grand-prix-1st-place-solution).","metadata":{"id":"gZfcudtGv7E-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Libraries Import\nIn this section, we import all necessary libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, model building, and evaluation.","metadata":{"id":"4V4Xo5xdv7E_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\n!pip install klib","metadata":{"id":"8-w96LmFv7E_","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-30T15:41:15.819662Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-30T15:41:15.820015Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-30T15:41:30.132297Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-30T15:41:15.819986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-30T15:41:30.131038Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport gc\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport joblib\nimport warnings\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport klib\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, OrdinalEncoder, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"id":"H2gvBOYGv7E_","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-30T15:41:30.134288Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-30T15:41:30.134603Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-30T15:41:33.159536Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-30T15:41:30.134577Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-30T15:41:33.158690Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Loading\nHere, we load the training dataset.

These functions help in optimizing memory usage, handling categorical features, and generating new features from existing ones. Let's walk through each of them.\n\n### Memory Optimization Function\n\nEfficient memory usage is crucial when dealing with large datasets. The `reduce_mem_usage` function iterates through all columns of a dataframe and modifies their data type to reduce memory consumption. This optimization ensures that we can handle the dataset more effectively without running into memory issues.\n\n### Safe Mapping Function\n\nHandling categorical features often involves mapping them to numerical values. The `safe_map` function ensures that we map these categories correctly and log any unknown categories that might be encountered during the process.\n\n### Feature Engineering Function\n\nFeature engineering is a critical step in enhancing model performance. The `feature_engineering` function creates new features by combining existing ones. These new features capture interactions between variables that might be predictive of the target variable.\nWe create new features by capturing the interactions between them and encoding that into categorical combinations. This can provide additional information to the model and improve its performance.\n##### Reference:

Here’s a recap of our journey:\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n- **Initial Explorations:** We kicked off with a subset of the data to get a quick grasp of its structure and nuances. This initial dive helped us spot potential issues and interesting patterns early on.\n- **KLIB Visualizations:** We utilized KLIB for streamlined visualizations and correlation analysis, making it easier to pinpoint key features and understand their relationships with the target variable.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n- **Handling Missing Values:** We meticulously checked for missing values to ensure data integrity throughout the modeling process.\n- **Categorical Encoding:** By converting categorical variables into numerical formats, we prepped the data for machine learning models.\n- **Memory Optimization:** To efficiently handle the large dataset, we optimized memory usage through downcasting of data types.\n\n### Feature Engineering\n- **Creating New Features:** We got creative with feature engineering, developing new features by combining existing ones. This allowed us to capture interactions between variables that could boost model performance.\n- **Scaling Numerical Features:** Standard scaling was applied to numerical features to bring them onto a similar scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.\n\n### Modeling and Evaluation\n- **Model Selection:** We chose three powerhouse models – CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost – each known for its unique strengths in handling structured data.\n- **Cross-Validation:** To get a reliable estimate of model performance, we used stratified k-fold cross-validation, ensuring our models were tested across diverse subsets of the data.\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Leveraging Optuna, we efficiently tuned the hyperparameters, squeezing out the best performance from our models.\n\n### Blending Predictions\n- **Ensemble Approach:** Instead of relying on a single model, we blended predictions from CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost based on their ROC-AUC scores. This ensemble method harnessed the strengths of each model, resulting in superior overall performance.","metadata":{"id":"miE1HKpVxNBK"}}]}
